MyYun
=====
My attempt at writing python code to get data from the Arduino on the Yun through Linux into a hosted application server.
In this scenario, I have a client to write to the SFDC developer org. 

It is a work in progress right now...

Here are some goals:
- Make it call a REST service
- Make it use the Object API
- Make it use WebSockets for other listeners and the ability to receive commands
